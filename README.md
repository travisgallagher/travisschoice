Description:
    Travis's Choice is a random restaurant generator. Most people have the same problem when trying to figure out where to go for lunch or dinner, and that is they cannot decide on one place between everyone. Travis's Choice looks to solve this problem by giving everybody a chance to eat at the restaurant they want, but having a program randomly select the restaurant you eat at. No more arguing with spouses or co-workers, just blame Travis!

How it Works:
     You enter your zipcode, and how many restaurants you would like to consider. Then select all of the restaurant's that sound good. This is where everyone can select there own option, and it gets considered in the final decision. Finally, you select the "Travis Choose" button, and the website will randomly select a restaurant for you, out of the restaurant's you or your group selected. This way everyone has a chance to get what they want, but in the end Travis Chooses!
